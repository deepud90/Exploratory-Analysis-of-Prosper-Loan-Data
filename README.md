# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Prosper-Loan-Data

Prosper is an online peer to peer lending platform that connects people who need money with those who are willing to loan the same for an interest. In this work, I analyse historical data from Prosper for the period 2005-2014, to understand more about the prosper lending business. Attempt has been made to answer a few central questions which shall form the theme of this work, and based on which the entire analysis is performed. Specifically, the analysis tries to understand how the prosper business has grown (and performed) over the years, identify the types of customers who are most likely to default, and evaluate how good prosper is at identifying good and bad loans.

This work is performed completely in R. Please refer to the file "EDA_prosper_final_github.md" for the detailed data exploration process (including R code as well as the descriptions). The dataset, as well as a description of the variables found in the same can be found in the link below
